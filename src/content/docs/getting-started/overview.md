title: Welcome to CX Handbook
description: Practical strategies and playbooks for Customer Experience leaders building world-class support teams.
---

The CX Handbook is designed to educate CX Professionals and Startup Execs on the best practices to setup and run customer-facing teams such as Customer Support and Customer Success. It was born out of Zach's experiences running teams at high-growth companies, and the recognition that patterns emerge across different companies and industries.

- The CX Handbook is inspired by the [High Growth Handbook, by Elad Gil](http://growth.eladgil.com/). The gap that we noticed in Elad's book was that it skips conversations about the customer. Instead, it focuses on important topics such as fundraising, growth, and product management.
- The amount of centralized and substantive information about Customer-facing roles (Customer Experience, Customer Support, etc) is low. Traditionally, there are very fragmented thoughts on the topic spread across company blogs, podcasts, or individual blogs.
