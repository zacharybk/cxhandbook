# Overview
This is an anonymized interview that I had with the Head of a Global Customer Support team. He was labeled as an expert in Customer Effort Score (CES), so I reached out to him in Support Driven, a fast-growing Slack group where Support Professionals can connect with one another. I wanted to better understand CES, how to implement it, and generally find another connection in the support world.

Throughout our discussion I received more than I was expecting. He blew me away with how thoroughly he explained the concepts along with how thoughtfully they researched and implemented CES. This post is my way to give back to the Support Driven Community.

In this interview we learn more about his decision to use CES, what CES is, and an idea of how to implement it. Without further ado, here’s the interview.

# Interview


## Tell us about your team:

We’re a team of ~50 people, working 24/7, doing about ~10k tickets per month! We’re spread between [California, South America, and Eastern Europe]. Our team is extremely knowledgable about our product and the questions we receive are very in-depth. We support [sic] software, and answer all conceivable questions about how to use the product, best practices, etc. A typical customer response is 3–5 paragraphs, written free-form and customized for each inquiry. Our team really knows the product inside and out!

In order to keep this all running, we support our agents with 3 tier-1 support managers, a manager for tier-2, a documentation writer, and an extensive training team of 3 people. The training team onboards 2–5 people per month, and it takes 2–2.5 months to become fully proficient!

## What type of performance do you measure?

We measure the typical things such as Time to First Response. We also have targets to answer all 90% of chats within 30 seconds and 90% of calls within 60 seconds. In the past we measured CSAT which we’ve replaced with Customer Effort Score (CES).

## What inspired you to implement CES?
Last year I read the book called The Effortless Experience: Conquering the New Battleground for Customer Loyalty (presentation), and chapter 6 completely changed how I thought about measuring the customer experience; It inspired me! It provides different ways to phrase questions and receive results for customer feedback. It’s very scientific yet easy to understand. The whole book is great!

The book claims that CSAT provides zero insight into the real meaningful indicators for a business. This made an impact on me because we were facing the same challenge as many other Zendesk customers. The Zendesk CAST benchmark results show that everyone scores ~95%. It was a very inaccurate signal without real meaning for us. In 2015 we did achieve a 96.5% CSAT rating! **← Great work!**

    The core element of CES is to understand a customers likelihood to repurchase, and we wanted a way to tie back a customer’s experience to sales which is our business’s lifeblood. This led us to start investigating how to implement CES.
