We all know that no matter what, you must respond to your customers, but how do you make that happen?

You want the majority of topics to be covered by Known-Knowns.
- Which interactions drive customer value?
- Which interactions should not exist (automate or fix)

- Turning Known-Unknowns into Known-Knowns
- An Unknown-Known is a business risk because it's information that someone in the company (probably) has, but it's not documented. Think about this as the "bus factor"
- "An unknown known is something that is known to some members of the team and not to all, or something that is known to the team but its significance is not appreciated."

Understanding Root Causes
- How to identify
- How to document root-causes
- Working cross-functionally

1. **Issue Recognition:** What is the customer actually asking, what scenario is at play, is it known to us or unknown? They basically run an IFTTT (If This Then That) scenario for every question. 
2. **Response:** How does a rep respond to the customer? This is the total package of the response: it includes the technical answer, steps taken to solve the issue, and the empathy that they add to the interaction. 
3. **Quality:** The last time we got this question customers liked/disliked the answer, so I'll answer this way to make the customer happier. 

- Training and sharing new knowledge
