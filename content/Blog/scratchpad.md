We all know that no matter what, you must respond to your customers, but how do you make that happen?

You want the majority of topics to be covered by Known-Knowns.
- Which interactions drive customer value?
- Which interactions should not exist (automate or fix)

- Turning Known-Unknowns into Known-Knowns
- An Unknown-Known is a business risk because it's information that someone in the company (probably) has, but it's not documented. Think about this as the "bus factor"
- "An unknown known is something that is known to some members of the team and not to all, or something that is known to the team but its significance is not appreciated."

Understanding Root Causes
- How to identify
- How to document root-causes
- Working cross-functionally

1. **Issue Recognition:** What is the customer actually asking, what scenario is at play, is it known to us or unknown? They basically run an IFTTT (If This Then That) scenario for every question. 
2. **Response:** How does a rep respond to the customer? This is the total package of the response: it includes the technical answer, steps taken to solve the issue, and the empathy that they add to the interaction. 
3. **Quality:** The last time we got this question customers liked/disliked the answer, so I'll answer this way to make the customer happier. 

- Training and sharing new knowledge

If you're lucky enough to work with or encounter a company with an excellent experience, take the time to tell them you appreciate it. The team behind your experience works really hard to deliver for you and other customers. 

I'll tell you a secret: if a company has a bad experience it's entirely because of the CEO/Founder or C-Level in charge of the function. Do not blame the team trying to execute. 

How could this be? The CEO probably isn't the one you're interacting with, so how can you blame them? A few reasons: 

- It's all about focus. In many companies you can tell what's important by where the budget is allocated - voting with dollars, not words. No or a menial allocation for the service teams likely means the experience will become subpar. 
- If there is money allocated and it's still bad? Same answer; it's the CEO's fault because they haven't taken the necessary steps to make it better. 

If the service is amazing, you should hear from the CEO how excellent the team is that's providing it to you. 

A quick story. I recently decided to frame a hand-written note of encouragement that I received in high school instead of carrying it in my backpack. So, I turned to our go-to framer, Framebridge. Admittedly, it has been >1 year since we had used them, but I was expecting the same level of service that makes me a repeat customer. 

The first frame job was slapdash and the custom matting was very inconsistent. Fair enough, I talked with their team, told them the issues and got a return label. They do have a policy of "love it or they'll reframe for free". 

On the redo I encountered many of the same issues. Here's the difference between a company that cares, and one that doesn't. When I cc'd the Framebridge CEO on the email she took ownership of the manufacturing issue and assigned a team lead to oversee my issue. It's expensive to operate this way with a guarantee, multiple shipments, and CEO-Level attention. As Framebridge seems to understand, it's more expensive to lose a loyal customer than it is to make it right. Here's hoping that they permanently fix their issues! 

# CX
Customer Experience, or CX, is how all of your customer's interactions come together to form the tangible and intangible thoughts or feelings about your company. When we talk here about the CX, it's inclusive of your Product interactions/performance, Customer Interactions, Support, Success, and self-help. For the sake of this site, we will focus the advice towards "customer-facing" teams such as Customer Support and Customer Success, and generally brand these as CX teams.  

Success Vs Support
To differentiate between Success and Support you can traditionally draw a hard-line and say that Success is Proactive and Support is Reactive. 

Here are examples of Reactive/Proactive
Success schedules QBRs
Success reaches out before a customer does
Support responds to emails/chats/phone calls
Support acts as a conduit to Engineering for customer-reported bugs

I am proposing that the days of these hard-lines are over, and that to win, a company must respond urgently to meet their customer needs. You must adapt quickly, or the next competitor will eat your lunch. In short, the metodologies that we will talk about on this site will help to transform all aspects of your CX into a proactive offense that increases customer loyalty, reduces churn, and improves the interactions your customers have with your product. 

# Layoffs
Do they 1:1
Do them when someone doesn't meet expectations
Have a plan in place that you'll get backfills

# Who Should our First CX hire be? 
I hear it time and time again from founders and execs: "I'm making my first CX hire and I'm not sure who to hire. Should they have 20 years of ex

Maybe they ask the same question for every function that they're running for the first time like Product or Sales. Maybe not. I'm here to say that it doesn't need to be such a hard question to answer. In fact, it requires planning and forethought. 

Some questions to help you plan: 
- What's your current state? Fab vs DO


You should have some idea of either how to lead support metrics or put someone in place who can figure it out. You can't leave this to chance for too long. 

# Who Should you Hire: Interview Series
Ask 10-15 people, the following type of questions:
Bio: Roles, founder/non-founnder, worked in CX: Support/Success
- When I say CX - what do you think of? 
- What was your experience hiring your first CX Leader? 
- What did you get right or wrong
- If they progressed their career in CX: What was important about growing your career in CX? Why do you think you had the success that you did
3 Scenarios, 1 question: Who should you hire to lead this function? What would you think about and plan for? Talk to your expeirence at each of these stages, what you got right, what you got wrong, and what you needed to work through. 
- Pre-launch startup, maybe some customers, but generally not much is happening. You're probably on v1 of your product: 
- Series A-B: You have product market fit, and the company is about to or has already experienced explosive growth. Example company: DigitalOcean from 2014. ~$15m in ARR, 35 people in the company, 100k+ customers
- Growth Stage: Your product is highly desired, customers are signing up organically, sales is humming along. You have 100-250 people in the company, sights on $1b+ ARR.
