We all know that no matter what, you must respond to your customers, but how do you make that happen?

You want the majority of topics to be covered by Known-Knowns.
- Which interactions drive customer value?
- Which interactions should not exist (automate or fix)

- Turning Known-Unknowns into Known-Knowns
- An Unknown-Known is a business risk because it's information that someone in the company (probably) has, but it's not documented. Think about this as the "bus factor"
- "An unknown known is something that is known to some members of the team and not to all, or something that is known to the team but its significance is not appreciated."

Understanding Root Causes
- How to identify
- How to document root-causes
- Working cross-functionally

1. **Issue Recognition:** What is the customer actually asking, what scenario is at play, is it known to us or unknown? They basically run an IFTTT (If This Then That) scenario for every question. 
2. **Response:** How does a rep respond to the customer? This is the total package of the response: it includes the technical answer, steps taken to solve the issue, and the empathy that they add to the interaction. 
3. **Quality:** The last time we got this question customers liked/disliked the answer, so I'll answer this way to make the customer happier. 

- Training and sharing new knowledge

If you're lucky enough to work with or encounter a company with an excellent experience, take the time to tell them you appreciate it. The team behind your experience works really hard to deliver for you and other customers. 

I'll tell you a secret: if a company has a bad experience it's entirely because of the CEO/Founder or C-Level in charge of the function. Do not blame the team trying to execute. 

How could this be? The CEO probably isn't the one you're interacting with, so how can you blame them? A few reasons: 

- It's all about focus. In many companies you can tell what's important by where the budget is allocated - voting with dollars, not words. No or a menial allocation for the service teams likely means the experience will become subpar. 
- If there is money allocated and it's still bad? Same answer; it's the CEO's fault because they haven't taken the necessary steps to make it better. 

If the service is amazing, you should hear from the CEO how excellent the team is that's providing it to you. 

A quick story. I recently decided to frame a hand-written note of encouragement that I received in high school instead of carrying it in my backpack. So, I turned to our go-to framer, Framebridge. Admittedly, it has been >1 year since we had used them, but I was expecting the same level of service that makes me a repeat customer. 

The first frame job was slapdash and the custom matting was very inconsistent. Fair enough, I talked with their team, told them the issues and got a return label. They do have a policy of "love it or they'll reframe for free". 

On the redo I encountered many of the same issues. Here's the difference between a company that cares, and one that doesn't. When I cc'd the Framebridge CEO on the email she took ownership of the manufacturing issue and assigned a team lead to oversee my issue. It's expensive to operate this way with a guarantee, multiple shipments, and CEO-Level attention. As Framebridge seems to understand, it's more expensive to lose a loyal customer than it is to make it right. Here's hoping that they permanently fix their issues!
